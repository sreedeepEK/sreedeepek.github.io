Hi, I'm Sreedeep. I translate data into meaningful insights, and also into hilarious presentations that have been known to induce uncontrollable laughter (or at least slightly confused snorting).

P.S. If you ever see me muttering to myself about logistic regression or the perfect visualization for cat video viewership data, feel free to say hi (just don't interrupt during peak analysis flow).
