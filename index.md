Hi, I'm Sreedeep. I turn boring data into stories so good, you'd think they were written by Shakespeare, if Shakespeare wrote about data. 

By day, I'm crunching numbers, building models, and uncovering hidden patterns in the data. By night, I'm... well, probably still at my desk, fueled by coffee and the thrill of discovery.

Anyway, If your are looking for my professional history, [click here](portfolio.md).
