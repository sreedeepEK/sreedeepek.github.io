## Introduction 

Ollama is an open-source project that serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on your local machine. It acts as a bridge between the complexities of LLM technology and the desire for an accessible and customizable AI experience.
Key Features and Functionalities
Ollama boasts a comprehensive set of features and functionalities designed to enhance the user experience and maximize the potential of local LLMs:

## Model Library and Management
Ollama provides access to a diverse and continuously expanding library of pre-trained LLM models, ranging from versatile general-purpose models to specialized ones tailored for specific domains or tasks. Downloading and managing these models is a seamless and streamlined process, eliminating the need to navigate complex model formats or dependencies.


In this guide, Let's walk through the process of downloading Ollama and integrating it into your workflow using Visual Studio Code.

#### Step 1: Installing Ollama
The first step is to install Ollama on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following pip command:

```
pip install ollama
```
or download ollama from their official website. 

#### Step 2: Setting up VSCode

If you haven’t already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: Visual Studio Code

Once installed, open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (Mac).

Search for and install the Python extension by Microsoft, which provides rich support for the Python language in VSCode.

#### Step 3: Creating a Python File

Now, let’s create a new Python file in VSCode where we’ll write some code to test Ollama. Click on the Explorer icon on the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+E or Cmd+Shift+E), then click on the New File icon (or press Ctrl+N or Cmd+N) to create a new file.

Save the file with a .py extension, for example, ollama_test.py.
